After looking over 4115 kickstarter projects for overall trends and then focusing on theater/play projects specifically.  Two items came up frequently for successful kickstarter campaigns.  They were one: Requesting money during the summer months, and two: Requesting a moderate amount of money.  
This graph illustrates the first point of timing being important for requests.
